### About me

I am a quantitative marine ecologist interested in applied research for a more proactive, sustainable and climate-resilient world. Broadly, my interests span seafood sustainability, fisheries, climate change, dynamic risk adaptation and ecological forecasting. Currently, I'm a postdoc at UC Davis in the [Provost Lab](https://mmprovost.com/), working on climate refugia for red abalone across California's marine estate. Outside of work, you can most likely find me hiking somewhere in Desolation Wilderness.
